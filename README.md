# webserv

Webserv is a project aimed at building a simple, yet fully functional web server in C++ that complies with the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

The goal is to handle incoming requests from clients (such as browsers) and serve responses dynamically, based on configuration files.

This project provides deep insight into how web servers operate, how HTTP works, and how requests are handled and processed efficiently.
